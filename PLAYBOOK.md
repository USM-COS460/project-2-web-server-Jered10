## COS 460/540 - Computer Networks
# Project 2: HTTP Server

# Jered Kalombo

This project is written in Java on Eclipse.

## How to compile

I used Eclipse for this project. You don't have to manually compile anything. Eclipse automatically does that for me. Just make sure all the files (like HttpServer.java) are inside the project's src folder.

## How to run

#### - In Eclipse, right-click the project and go to Run As -> Run Configurations
#### - Under the Arguments tab, in the Program arguments box, type the port number and the folder for your document root.
#### eg. 1029 Folder
#### - click Apply, then Run
#### - Open a browser and go to: 
#### http://localhost:1029
### If everything is correct you should see the HTTPD Server Test Page, and clicking the kitten image should open the larger image. 

## My experience with this project

I used Java sockets
